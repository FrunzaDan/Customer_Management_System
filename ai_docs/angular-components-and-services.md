# Angular Components & Services

## What it is

The route/component map, the customer services layer, and two real bugs that were fixed here (worth knowing so they aren't reintroduced).

## Key files / paths

- `UI/customer_management_system/src/app/components/*`
- `UI/customer_management_system/src/app/services/*`

## How it works

**Components** (`src/app/components/`):

| Component | Route | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `user-login` | `/login` | Merchant sign-in form |
| `home` | `/`, `/customers` | Customer list landing page (just a heading + `app-customer-list`; the "Register customer" button lives in the customer-list toolbar, not here) |
| `customer-list` | (used by `home`) | Table of customers, `@for` track-by GUID; server-side search, sort, and pagination |
| `customer-details` | `/customerDetails` | Single customer's full record (friendly status) plus its audit trail |
| `global-audit-log` | `/auditLog` | Paginated audit trail across every customer, newest first |
| `add-customer` | `/addCustomer` | Create-customer form |
| `edit-customer` | `/editCustomer` | Edit-customer form |
| `features` | `/features` | Static feature list page |
| `about` | `/about` | Static about page |
| `navigation-bar` | (shown/hidden via `NavbarService`) | Top nav — hidden on `/login`; owns the "Log out" action |
| `footer` | (shown/hidden via `FooterService`) | Page footer — hidden on `/login` |
| `display-error` | n/a | Reusable error display |
| `page-not-found` | `**` | 404 fallback |

Gender is stored/sent as an **integer**: `0` = Not declared, `1` = Male, `2` = Female — canonicalized across `add-customer` and `edit-customer` forms (both used to disagree on string vs. numeric values; now fixed to match `tbl_customers.gender`).

**Services** (`src/app/services/`):
- `user-login.service.ts`, `verify-token.service.ts`, `auth-guard.service.ts`, `session-storage.service.ts`, `http-header-service.ts`, `auth-error.interceptor.ts` — see [[angular-login-flow]] and [[angular-app-config-and-routing]].
- `get-customer.service.ts`, `add-customer.service.ts`, `edit-customer.service.ts`, `activate-customer.service.ts`, `delete-customer.service.ts`, `audit-log.service.ts`, `export-customer.service.ts`, `global-audit-log.service.ts` — one per `CustomerController` endpoint group (see [[api-request-pipeline]]).
- `navbar.service.ts`, `footer.service.ts` — simple show/hide state for chrome that shouldn't appear on the login screen.

**Customer lifecycle actions in the UI** (`customer-list.component.ts`, `customer-details.component.ts`): Edit is always available; Deactivate shows only when active; Reactivate and Delete show only when deactivated — mirroring the stored-procedure rules in [[customer-data-model-and-lifecycle]] rather than re-deriving them. Both Deactivate and Delete are guarded by a native `confirm()` prompt before the request fires; Reactivate and Edit are not (both are non-destructive/reversible).

**Search, sorting & pagination** (`customer-list.component.ts`): all three are server-side now — `GET /api/Customer/all` takes `pageNumber`, `pageSize` (20, capped at 100, see `CustomerGetting.MaxPageSize`), `searchTerm`, `sortColumn` (`name`/`email`/`msisdn`), `sortDirection` (`asc`/`desc`), and `usp_getCustomers` does the filtering/sorting/paging in SQL (`WHERE` + a parameterized `CASE`-based `ORDER BY` + `OFFSET`/`FETCH`, with `COUNT(*) OVER()` for the total). `GetCustomerService.loadCustomers(params)` re-fetches on every change to page, search term, or sort; `customersSignal` holds only the current page, not the whole table. Changing the search term or clicking a column header resets to page 1. The search box is debounced (300ms) since each keystroke is now a network call, not an in-memory filter. Pagination controls only render when there's more than one page — with the two seeded demo customers you'll never see them locally; that's expected, not a bug. A Status column renders each row's `customerStatus` as a colored badge via `statusLabels` (Active/Deactivated/Test, same three codes as [[customer-data-model-and-lifecycle]]) — display only, not sortable/filterable server-side.

**Audit trail** (`customer-details.component.ts`): `AuditLogService.loadAuditLog(guid)` is called in `ngOnInit` alongside the customer fetch, and rendered as its own card (newest first). Unlike the customer record itself (which updates in place via `updateCustomerLocally`), the audit list has no local-patch path, so it's re-fetched via a constructor `effect()` that watches `activationLoading()` and reloads on the true→false transition (i.e. right after a deactivate/reactivate call resolves) — without this, the trail would look stale until the next full page load even though the status right above it just updated live.

**Toolbar & button styling** (`customer-list.component.ts`/`.html`): the search box, Export CSV, Register customer, and Bulk delete buttons all sit on one `d-flex flex-wrap` row above the table — `addCustomer()` on `CustomerListComponent` just navigates to `/addCustomer` (moved here from `HomeComponent`, which now only renders a heading + `<app-customer-list>`). All non-destructive action buttons (Edit, Export CSV, Register customer, Reactivate, pagination Previous/Next) use `btn btn-primary`; only genuinely destructive/irreversible actions (Deactivate, Delete, Bulk delete) stay `btn-danger`. `.btn-primary`'s green comes from the single global override in `styles.css` (`--spectrumColor2`) — don't re-add a component-local `.btn-primary` override (customer-list used to shadow it with `--spectrumColor1`, a different shade, making its Edit button visibly mismatched from every other primary button in the app).

**CSV export** (`customer-list.component.ts`): the "Export CSV" button calls `ExportCustomerService.exportCustomers()` with the list's *current* `searchTerm`/`sortColumn`/`sortDirection` signals — same filter/sort the table is showing, but not limited to the current page (see [[customer-data-model-and-lifecycle]]). The service requests the API with `responseType: 'blob'` and triggers the browser download itself (`URL.createObjectURL` + a synthetic `<a download>` click) with a client-generated filename, rather than reading the server's `Content-Disposition` filename — that header isn't in the API's CORS exposed-headers list, so JS can't read it cross-origin, and exposing it wasn't judged worth widening the CORS config for.

**Global audit log** (`global-audit-log.component.ts`, `/auditLog`): like `customer-list`, pagination is server-side (`GlobalAuditLogService.loadAllAuditLog`, `GET /api/Customer/auditLog/all`), but there's no search or sort — just a newest-first paginated table (page size 20, same as the customer list). A row's customer name links to `/customerDetails` only when the customer still exists (`entry.customerFirstName`/`customerLastName` non-null); a deleted customer renders as plain text, `(deleted customer <guid>)` — see [[customer-data-model-and-lifecycle]] for why the API can return rows for a GUID that no longer resolves to a customer.

**Birthdate is a native `<input type="date">`** in both `add-customer` and `edit-customer` — replaced three separate year/month/day text boxes. The API still just wants `YYYY-MM-DD` (that's what `usp_createCustomer`/`usp_editCustomer` store as-is in `tbl_customers.birthdate`, an `NVARCHAR`, not a real `DATE` column), and a date input's `.value` is always exactly that format, so no manual concatenation is needed on submit anymore. When *editing* an existing customer, `EditCustomerComponent.toDateInputValue()` zero-pads the stored value before patching the form — a date input silently fails to pre-fill on anything not strictly zero-padded, and the old three-box form could have saved e.g. `"2020-1-5"` for some existing records.

**Frontend unit tests**: the project was scaffolded straight onto Vitest (`@angular/build:unit-test` + `"runner": "vitest"` in `angular.json`, `"types": ["vitest/globals"]` in `tsconfig.spec.json`) — there's no Karma here to migrate away from, despite that being the more commonly-seen setup in older Angular tutorials. `describe`/`it`/`expect`/`vi`/etc. are global (no imports needed). `jsdom` is the DOM-emulation dependency (installed as a devDependency — Vitest requires either that or `happy-dom` and picks whichever is present). Run with `ng test` (or `ng test --watch=false` for a single run). Coverage: `get-customer.service.spec.ts` and `audit-log.service.spec.ts` mock HTTP via `provideHttpClientTesting()`/`HttpTestingController`; `customer-list.component.spec.ts` constructs the component directly via `TestBed.runInInjectionContext(() => new CustomerListComponent())` with hand-rolled service stubs (not `TestBed.createComponent`, since these tests exercise the sort/paging/search-debounce logic, not the template) — that pattern is required because the component uses field-initializer `inject()` calls, which need an active injection context to run.

## Gotchas / conventions

- `customer-list.component.ts`'s duplicate-GUID check runs as an `effect()` over the `duplicateGuids` computed signal, in the **constructor** (not `ngOnInit`) — it re-evaluates whenever `customers()` actually changes. A one-time synchronous check right after the async `loadCustomers()` call used to always see a stale/empty list and never fire; don't move this back to a one-shot check in `ngOnInit`.
- See [[angular-app-config-and-routing]] for why `verify-token.service.ts` must stay a simple `pipe(map/catchError)` and not go back to a manually-managed `Subject`.
- `NavigationBarComponent.logout()` explicitly calls `SessionStorageService.removeSessionStorage()` before navigating to `/login` — don't replace it with a plain `routerLink="login"` again. It used to be exactly that, and only "worked" because `UserLoginComponent.ngOnInit()` happens to clear storage too; that's an implicit dependency on another component's unrelated side effect, not something logout should rely on. See [[known-gaps]] for the fix history.
